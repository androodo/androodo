Hi, I’m @androodo
I’m currently learning at the University of California, Riverside(UCR), majoring in Computer Science BS+MS, Class of 2027. I am actively enhancing my programming skills and gaining knowledge in various computer science disciplines.
I’m looking to collaborate on diverse software projects and team initiatives. I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals. I am particularly interested in joining projects that allow for creative problem-solving and tech innovation.
Feel free to connect with me for  collaborative projects or to just to exchange ideas. You can reach me at doandrew21@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-do-93b14b17a.
